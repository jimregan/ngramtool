# This is the surprisingly simple Makefile.
# I don't like the way gmake and automake work, they tend to cause more
# problems. Therefore I use Jam instead.
#
# This file does the following things:
# First, it builds jam executable in tools/jam if it is not availiable on the
# system. 
# Then it forwards all building requests to Jam
# Jam is the building tool of the well known Boost C++ lib:
# http://www.boost.org

all: tools/jam build_all

build_all:
	@tools/jam -d0

	@tools/jam clean
